# sentry demo project

this project is just a demo of how to use sentry or how it looks to be using sentry and how the error detection works

anyway we have seen how to use sentry and how it looks to be using sentry and how the error detection works

sentry has a trial of 14 days and for now we dont need sentry at all. also it provides a functions to be called when an error happens.

so becuase of this we wont go further with this project
this is kinda sufficient for now

Note: when i init the sentry at setup.py it didnt work but when i init in main.py it worked it looks like its need to be in the main app file [main.py]

also sentry provide configured sdk for django and flask and other frameworks it has many frameworks with python specially.

here is a link of playlist about python sentry
